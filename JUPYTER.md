# Jypter Notebook

You can use Jupyter notebook from your browser by vising our server's
address http://10.30.5.4 to run python code for data analysis. If all
goes well, you shall be prompted for login upon visiting the link. If
your user account hasn't yet been created, you may request for account
creation with @wilkerje or someone else at the lab.

Few things to know about the Jypter notebook running in our system:
1. The instance running in our server is callled [the littlest jupyter
   hub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/custom-server.html).
If you're trying to manage/configure the installation, the site
aforementioned has several helpful guides.

### Why
The rationale behind using a system like Jupyter notebook is to
provide a playground where there's data for the code to run on too.
Since most of what we do after data processing is data analysis, it
would be ideal if researchers have a platform where they can write
code without having to worry about the latest copy of data to run
their code on. In addition to data, a system like this also makes it
easy to share code for helper functions that all researchers might
find useful. 

### How can I install xxx package?
The administrator account is responsible for installing python
packages that are available in the playground. One admin account is
m23. If you're an adminstrator trying to manage python packages and
versions for your users and yourself, this article might be helpful
